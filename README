Code Sample
Author: Michael Lin

Code sample from a larger project from the course "Programming and Problem 
Solving". The original project goals were to program a player for a game "Pentocity".
Players are given an empty 50x50 grid of land to develop for residential and
factory buildings. A simulation is run where at each step, a random building
request is given to the player, and the player must dynamically decide its
placement on the land, subject to certain rules, including: factories must not
be placed next to residences, all buildings must be connected to the perimeter
via roads. The total score is determined by the number of buildings placed down,
with bonuses given to residences placed next to park and pond cells. The full
game is described here: http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kar/4444f16/node17.html.

Description of code sample:
At each step of the simulation, the play() function is called, providing the
player with the next building request and the current state of the 50x50 land.
A building request contains information such as its type, a set of cells, and a
rotation of those cells. play() must return a valid Move object containing
the Building object, the rotation desired, its position to be placed on the board,
and any road, water, or park cells to be built along with the building.
